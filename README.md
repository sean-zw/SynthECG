# SynthECG ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_progress-yellow)

🚧 **Under Construction**

This project is in active development. The README and codebase are still being refactored.

## Models

The code includes four state-of-the-art generative deep learning models to generate the ECG signals:

- **WaveGAN\*** - Modified WaveGAN architecture for ECG generation
- **Pulse2Pulse** - U-Net based GAN model
- **SSSD-ECG** - Structured State Space Diffusion model
- **DSAT-ECG** - Diffusion State Space Augmented Transformer

If you want to add your model, just fork this repo and set up a pull request. I will try to review the code as soon as possible.

## Setup

### Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA capability (minimum 16GB VRAM, recommended 24GB+)
- **CUDA**: 12.4.0
- **GCC**: 11.3.0
- **Python**: 3.11

### Linux

Setting up the codebase in a linux environment should be pretty straightforward:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment with Python3.11
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Build CUDA extensions: `python setup.py install`

Do not forget to prepare the PTB-XL data and update the config files for the models.
You should now be ready to go!

### Windows/Docker Setup

Setting up on Windows or other non-Linux systems requires Docker with GPU support. 

**📋 [Docker Setup Guide](.devcontainer/README.md)**

After setting up Docker, follow the Linux setup steps above.


## Features

### Training

`train_wavegan.py`

`train_p2p.py`

`train_sssd.py`

`train_dsat.py`

Train each of the models.

### Sampling

`sample.py`

Sample trained model checkpoints matching PTB-XL dataset.

### Evaluating

`evaluate.py`

For both validation and tesing.
